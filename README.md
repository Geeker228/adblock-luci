Simple AdBlock installation script for OpenWRT

Just run uninstall.sh

# Minimum hardware 
It is recommended to have more than 20MB free storage, but it will work fine even with 15MB. You can try to use it on less storage if not using all blocklists at one time.
It is developed especially for devices that cannot handle Adguard Home or Pi-Hole, so it uses as less CPU and RAM as possible.
